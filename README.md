# 7800 Pokey Engine

Welcome to the 7800 pokey engine for music and sound effects playback on the Atari 7800 Console. This engine was initially developed (based on the disassembly and reverse engineering of Ms. Pac-man by Atari) by Perry Thuente (tep392) and Bob DeCrescenzo (pacmanplus) for the purpose of providing pokey sound playback for the Pac-man Collection. The engine has since been enhanced and is now also being used for other homebrew titles such as Millie & Molly 7800 (Matthew Smith), Popeye (Darryl Guenther) and Danger Zone (Lewis Hill) thanks to the awesome music abilities of Bobby Clark.

The 7800 pokey engine has been kindly open-sourced by the contributors and is freely available to the AtariAge community for use within any project. 

The source is currently maintained by Matthew Smith (mksmith).
